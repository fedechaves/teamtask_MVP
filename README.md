# Lessons Learned:

In using the MVC Structure for our CRUD application, we learned how data flows from the model to the view to the controller. We learned to apply our data to let a user create a task, assign that task to themselves or another teamate, pick a due date for the task, and apply a dropdown for status updates. 

Our biggest challenge was showing the status updates for the team task views.  In the future We would like to implement administative roles, a team dashboard, and add a choice for Google Authentication for login.

# How to Get it Working:

Add a .env file in the config folder with these two values:
* PORT = 2121 //or whatever you choose
* DB_STRING =  //MongoDB connection string
